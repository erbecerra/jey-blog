# Estefanie, Jeanne, Yia's Team Project Jey-Blog

### Problem Statement

Majority of websites exists there have Blog in addition to the main features of a web application.
Some of the reasons of having blog are to increase the traffic on a given website, 
getting users feedback about what they like and issues etc... 

It is not easy to find a free and simple blog post REST API for developer to consume and add this feature on web applications.
 The jey-blog application will provide simple CRUD blog-post REST API endpoints to developers to consume while adding blog.
